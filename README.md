Technically, this isn't my first repository.  The other repos I posted.... I really had no idea what I was doing. 
Consider this as my first official repository on GitHub.

I enjoy :running: and :books:. 

:mortar_board: I've applied to grad school :raised_hands:. I'm nervous to go back to school, but excited to see what the future holds.  

 My sign is a :libra:, which probably says a lot already :relaxed:
